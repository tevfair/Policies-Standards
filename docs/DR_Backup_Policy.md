## Introduction

This policy provides guidelines for secure backup and recovery processes within our cloud environment, ensuring that critical data is adequately protected, readily available, and can be restored in the event of data loss or corruption.

<a name="scope"></a>

## Scope

This policy covers all data, applications, and services within our cloud environment that require backup and potential recovery.

<a name="backup-management"></a>

## Backup Management

### Policy 100 - 01: Backup Frequency

- **Description**: Define the frequency of backups based on data criticality.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Critical systems should have daily backups, others might be less frequent.

### Policy 100 - 02: Backup Location

- **Description**: Backups should be stored in geographically separate locations from the primary data.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Utilize cloud regions or data centers in different geographic zones.

### Policy 100 - 03: Backup Isolation

- **Description**: Ensure backups are isolated and protected from the main environment.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Implement separate access controls and network segmentation for backup storage.

## Recovery Management

### Policy 100 - 04: Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

- **Description**: Define the maximum acceptable time that a system can be down after a disaster.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Prioritize critical systems with a lower RTO.

### Policy 100 - 05: Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

- **Description**: Define the maximum age of files that must be recovered from backup storage for normal operations to resume.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Ensure backup frequency aligns with RPO needs.

<a name="testing-and-verification"></a>

## Testing and Verification

### Policy 100 - 06: Regular Backup Tests

- **Description**: Backups should be tested regularly to ensure data integrity and recoverability.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Schedule quarterly backup recovery tests.

### Policy 100 - 07: Validation of Data

- **Description**: Verify the integrity of backups.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Use checksums or hashes to ensure data hasn't been altered.

<a name="data-retention"></a>

## Data Retention

### Policy 100 - 08: Retention Period

- **Description**: Define how long backups are to be retained.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Align with organizational and regulatory requirements.

### Policy 100 - 09: Secure Deletion

- **Description**: Once past their retention period, backups should be securely deleted.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Utilize certified tools or services for secure data disposal.

<a name="encryption-and-data-protection"></a>

## Encryption and Data Protection

### Policy 100 - 10: Backup Encryption

- **Description**: All backups must be encrypted, both at rest and during transit.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Utilize AES-256 encryption or higher.

### Policy 100 - 11: Access Control to Backups

- **Description**: Restrict and monitor access to backups.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Implement strict RBAC and monitor access logs for unauthorized activity.

*Note*: This Backup and Recovery policy is a template and should be customized to the organization's specific cloud environment, needs, and regulatory landscape. It's essential to review and update it regularly, and also ensure that relevant stakeholders are trained on its provisions.
