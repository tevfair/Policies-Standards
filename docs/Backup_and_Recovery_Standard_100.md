- **Implementation**:
  - Prioritize critical systems with a lower RTO.

---

### Standard 100 - 05: Align backup frequency with RPO requirements

- **Description**: Define the maximum age of files that must be recovered from backup storage for normal operations to resume.
- **Policy Mapping**:

- **CIS Mapping**:
  - CIS Control: 10.9 (Define and adhere to RPO)
- **CSA CCM Mapping**:
  - CSA CCM: DRR-01.2 (Recovery consistency)
- **Implementation**:
  - Ensure backup frequency aligns with RPO needs.

---

### Standard 100 - 06: Perform regular backup recovery tests

- **Description**: Backups should be tested regularly to ensure data integrity and recoverability.
- **Policy Mapping**:
  - Policy 100 - 06: Regular Backup Tests
  - Policy 100 - 07: Validation of Data
- **CIS Mapping**:
  - CIS Control: 10.10 (Regularly test backups for integrity)

- **CIS Mapping**:
  - CIS Control: 10.11 (Use checksums for backup validation)
- **CSA CCM Mapping**:
  - CSA CCM: DRR-02.2 (Backup data integrity verification)
- **Implementation**:
  - Use checksums or hashes to ensure data hasn't been altered.

---

### Standard 100 - 08: Adhere to defined data retention periods

- **Description**: Define how long backups are to be retained.
- **Policy Mapping**:
  - Policy 100 - 08: Retention Period
- **CIS Mapping**:
  - CIS Control: 10.12 (Maintain backups for the defined retention period)
- **CSA CCM Mapping**:
  - CSA CCM: DSP-03.1 (Data retention policies)
- **Implementation**:
  - Align with organizational and regulatory requirements.

---

### Standard 100 - 09: Use certified tools for data disposal post-retention period

- **Description**: Once past their retention period, backups should be securely deleted.
- **Policy Mapping**:
  - Policy 100 - 09: Secure Deletion
- **CIS Mapping**:
