## Introduction

Establish guidelines to ensure comprehensive vulnerability management within the cloud environment. This policy aims to promptly recognize, evaluate, and address potential security loopholes, reducing exposure risks.

<a name="scope"></a>

## Scope

This policy is relevant to all cloud assets, be they applications, services, or infrastructure, that the organization manages, encapsulating components like IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.

<a name="vulnerability-identification"></a>

## Vulnerability Identification

### Policy 200 - 01: Regular Scanning

- **Description**: Implement recurring vulnerability scans on cloud assets to identify prevalent vulnerabilities.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Utilize either cloud-native tools or trusted third-party tools specialized in vulnerability scanning.
  - Schedule scans during off-peak hours to minimize disruptions.

### Policy 200 - 02: Threat Intelligence Integration

- **Description**: Merge threat intelligence sources to remain informed on emerging vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Engage with threat intelligence platforms.
  - Amalgamate them with SIEM solutions for a comprehensive threat landscape.

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Policy 200 - 03: Risk Rating

- **Description**: Rank vulnerabilities by their potential severity and probable impact.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Reference the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) for evaluations.
  - Update risk ratings when new information is available.

### Policy 200 - 04: False Positive Handling

- **Description**: Authenticate vulnerability findings to discard false positives.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Collaborate with cloud security teams for validation.
  - Use sandbox environments for testing where applicable.

<a name="vulnerability-remediation"></a>

## Vulnerability Remediation

### Policy 200 - 05: Patch Management

- **Description**: Assure prompt patching of vulnerabilities.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Prioritize automatic patching where practical.
  - Conduct manual patching processes when required.

### Policy 200 - 06: Remediation Timelines

- **Description**: Establish deadlines for remediation activities based on the risk assessments of vulnerabilities.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Address critical risks within 7 days.
  - Set escalating reminders for pending remediations.

### Policy 200 - 07: Configuration Management

- **Description**: Standardize secure configurations of cloud assets to diminish vulnerabilities originating from misconfigurations.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Frequently consult best practices proposed by the cloud provider.
  - Perform regular configuration audits.

<a name="communication-and-disclosure"></a>

## Communication and Disclosure

### Policy 200 - 08: Internal Communication

- **Description**: Update pertinent internal stakeholders about identified vulnerabilities and devised remediation strategies.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Design a communication blueprint.
  - Conduct periodic stakeholder awareness sessions.

### Policy 200 - 09: Responsible Disclosure

- **Description**: For vulnerabilities impacting external entities or customers, uphold responsible disclosure norms.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Inform the affected entities with actionable insights.
  - Abstain from public revelations until remediation is available.

<a name="monitoring-and-review"></a>

## Monitoring and Review

### Policy 200 - 10: Continuous Monitoring

- **Description**: Maintain uninterrupted surveillance of cloud assets for potential exploitation indications.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Incorporate cloud-native monitoring tools.
  - Integrate with SIEM systems for enhanced visibility.

### Policy 200 - 11: Policy Review

- **Description**: Periodically revisit and refine the vulnerability management policy.
- **Associated Guideline**:
  - Mandate a review either annually.
  - Revisit following any significant modifications in the cloud infrastructure.
